# ü§ñ Bottica Core

The `bottica` specification and list of verifiers: [`bottica.yaml`](./bottica.yaml).

The `bottica` object contains a single entry, `bots`. Its value is a list
of bots, which have a `name` and one or more verifiers. A json-schema of
`bottica` is available at [`schema.yaml`](./schema.yaml).

We aim for bot names to be in with sync their User-Agent family as parsed
by the [ua-parser project](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) (UAP)
to maximize interoperability.

In all entries where an IP is required, `bottica` supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

## ‚úÖ Verifiers

Each entry in `bottica` can have one or more verifiers. For example,
`Pinterestbot` traffic should be both verified by FCrDNS, _and_ it should
come from a specific IP range:

```yaml
- name: Pinterestbot
  ip_ranges:
    - min: 54.236.1.1
      max: 54.236.1.255
  fcrdns_hosts:
    - pinterest.com
```

The supported verifiers are:
* üîÑ [`fcrdns_hosts`](#-fcrdns-hosts): Forward-confirmed reverse DNS.
* üìÉ [`ip_list`](#-ip-list): Simple IP whitelist
* üèî [`ip_ranges`](#-ip-ranges): Whitelisting of ranges of IPs
* üçé [`cidr_list`](#-cidr-list): Whitelisting of CIDR blocks

### üîÑ FCrDNS hosts

`fcrdns_hosts` should contain a list of hosts that are allowed to
participate in a [FCrDNS lookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-confirmed_reverse_DNS):

1. A reverse DNS query is performed on an IP to check its reported hostname
2. A DNS query is performed on the hostname to get its reported list of IPs.
   The original IP should appear in the hosts list of IPs if the reported host
   name hasn't been spoofed.

If the list `fcrdns_hosts` list is present but empty, an FCrDNS check will
be performed, with a positive verification as long as the IP matches the
host's reported IP list. If there are hosts listed under `fcrdns_hosts`, then the
verification will additionally only succeed if the last part of the hostname
matches one of the entries.

**Example**
```yaml
- name: Googlebot
  fcrdns_hosts:
    - google.com
    - googlebot.com
```

### üìÉ IP list

A simple whitelist of allowed IP addresses.

**Example**
```yaml
- name: DuckDuckBot
  ip_list:
    - 23.21.227.69
    - 50.16.241.113
    - 50.16.241.114
    - 50.16.241.117
    - 50.16.247.234
    - 52.204.97.54
    - 52.5.190.19
    - 54.197.234.188
    - 54.208.100.253
    - 54.208.102.37
    - 107.21.1.8
```


### üèî IP ranges

A list of IP ranges, one of which must contain the bot's IP. A range is
specified with the `min` IP and the `max` IP, with both boundaries
being inclusive.

**Example**

```yaml
- name: Pinterestbot
  ip_ranges:
    - min: 54.236.1.1
      max: 54.236.1.255
```

### üçé CIDR list

A list of CIDR blocks, one of which must contain the bot's IP address.

**Example**

```yaml
- name: AhrefsBot
  # https://ahrefs.com/robot
  cidr_list:
    - 54.36.148.0/24
    - 54.36.149.0/24
    - 54.36.150.0/24
    - 195.154.122.0/24
    - 195.154.123.0/24
    - 195.154.126.0/24
    - 195.154.127.0/24
```


## ‚ûï UAP Extras

Since `ua-parser` is an external dependency, it is sometimes necessary
to make some additions or tweaks to their parsing, e.g. in cases where
a major bot is missing, or when their parsed family is too specific
(think of one bot going under many different names, which would all
require separate entries in `bottica`).
[`uap_extras.yaml`](./uap_extras.yaml) provides overrides and additions
to the User-Agent parsing from
[uap-core](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core). These should only
contain a regex to match, and possibly a `family_name` override for
setting the bot's name. If provided, `family_name` must match one of
the bot names in `bottica`. If not provided, the first matching group
of the `regex` must always match one of the bot names in `bottica`.
